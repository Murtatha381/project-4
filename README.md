### Heart Attack Risk Prediction and Analysis
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Team Members:
* Patrick Schulze
* Libnis Sanchez
* Murtatha Alwan
* Callie Carlton
* Dianna Rivera

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Project Outline
### Project Description
This project attempts to find correlation between heart attack risk and various lifestyle factors, such as BMI, income, age, sex, etc.  

### Data Collection, Model Building, and Analysis
1. Imported data found in Kaggle
2. Cleaned and prepared data (ETL) in Jupyter Notebook
3. Created machine learning models to determine accuracy of risk conclusions
4. Compared variables to address research questions

### Presentation and Summarization 
4. Created and presented a formal visual presentation
5. Drafted written analysis of the data
6. Summarized conclusions

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Research Questions
1. How does income affect heart attack risk?
2. How does level of education affect heart attack risk
3. How does a person's age affect their risk? What about their sex?
4. Does smoking affect a person's risk for heart attack? What about alcohol consumption?
5. How does physical activity affect heart attack risk?
6. How does mental health affect heart attack risk?
